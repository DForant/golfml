== Description of Golf Courses ==

The description of golf courses consists not only in general data like name, address, contact phone number, email address, and web site, but also in more technical details of interest to the game of golf.

A golf course consists generally of 18 holes. Golfers can play these holes from different starting positions (tees) depending on their skills.

To prepare a round of golf, players usually have access to some reference information provided by the course itself or by specialized companies: Scorecard, general map of the course, but also "yardage" books and even sometimes private notes and drawings.

A hole of a course is piece of land with hasards, traps, natural obstacle... usually marked in drawings or maps. Often, courses also contain distance markers to help the golfer estimate the distance to a target.

All these elements should be included in GolfML, in a structured way.

For example, scorecards with hole pars, distances, and handicap indices are modelized in a structure XML document.

Yardage books in electronic form, maps, pictures, videos of hole overview can also be of interest to golfers. GolfML provides a structured way to describe and _reference_ such information.

Hole descriptions with markers, position of hasards or natural obstacle, green shape and sizes, and personal notes,  can also be stored to document holes.

The purpose of this documentation of a golf course is to collect information in a unique, structured, organized document. It is left to the golf application programmer to use or not those structure defined to describe a golf course.
