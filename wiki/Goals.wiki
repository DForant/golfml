#summary Golf Markup Language: General Goals.
#sidebar TableOfContents

The goals of GolfML is to provide a language for:
 # The description of golf courses.
 # The record of golf rounds, scorecards, statistics, and equipment.


= 1. Description of Golf Courses =

The description of golf courses consists of
 * general data like name, address, contact phone number, email address, and web site,
 * technical details of interest to the game of golf.

A golf course generally consists of 18 holes. Golfers can play these holes from different starting positions (tees) depending on their skills.

To prepare a round of golf, players usually have access to some reference information provided by the course itself or by specialized companies or web sites: Scorecard, general map of the course, "yardage" books, pin placement sheets, notes and drawings. A hole on a course is piece of land with hasards, traps, natural obstacle... marked on drawings or maps. Courses also contain distance markers to help the golfer estimate the distance to a target. All these elements can be included in a GolfML document in a structured way:

 * Scorecards with hole pars, distances, and handicap indices;
 * Yardage books in electronic form, maps, pictures, videos of hole overview;
 * Hole descriptions with markers, position of hasards or natural obstacle, green shape and sizes, GPS positions, personal notes.

The purpose of this _documentation_ of a golf course is to collect information in a unique, structured, organized GolfML document that can be shared among golfer and that can be used by applications to present that information to golfers: It is possible to generate scorecards. If geographic information has been entered for a golf course, with markers and polygons that describe fairways, traps, greens, and lakes, it is possible to generate a yardage book from the available data. [CaseStudy1 (It is easy to do so in Google Earth for instance.)]

Information about golf courses, layouts, distances... can change over time, and that information can be stored in a GolfML document as well.


= 2. Records of Rounds of Golf, Scorecards, Statistics, and Equipment =

Golfers like to keep scores, notes, and sometimes more information to track the progress of their game. The purpose of this section is to provide a place to collect such information, store it, organize it, and later refer to it to analyze the game.

In addition to score, golfer are able to record the position of the ball after each stroke (sometimes refered to as "location aware scorecard"), information about the club used, the quality of the shot and its result, notes about the hole or the course.

Golfers often play a variety of games and challenges for fun or money. GolfML has room to keep a track of such information in a simple way as well.

Players like to analyze their games through various statistics. While statistics can always be re-computed from raw data, it is convenient to keep a baselined, denormalized version of some statistics. It is simply easier and more convenient to store the computed value rather than recomputing the value each time. For example, a player may want to keep his scoring average per quarter. It is simply easier to store the value in a statistic section at the end of each quarter rather than computing the value each time it is needed.

GolfML offers a structured construct to store statistical information, together with data related to the statistics (period covered, courses used, rounds considered...) and methods used to derive the computed value.

GolfML also offers a place to record golf-related belongings such as golf clubs, ball used, contents of golf bags, together with additional information (average distance of stroke with each club, brand, model, physical characteristics...)


= Notes about GolfML Alternatives =

The primary goal of GolfML is to record golf-related data from players.

SportML has a section dedicated to the game of golf. SportML is oriented towards the communication of results in sport events. While SportML has features to store information such as player characteristics, statistics, and results of rounds of golf, SportML is not designed to store other golf-related or detailed information about a game. SportML cannot store information about course length, design, marker positions, SportML cannot record details about strokes, ball position, or content of a bag of golf. It was simply not design to record such information.
