#summary Generating Google Code Wiki-Style Documentation from XML Schema Annotation/Documentation

= Introduction =

xml2wiki is a XSL style sheet designed to build Google Code Wiki-style documentation directly from XML Schema annotation and documentation elements.


= Details =

The excellent xframe framework allows for automatic HTML documentation generation from XML Schema annotation and documentation elements.

A debug option of xframe allow for generation of an intermediate XML documentation format which contains not only pre-formatted elements (such as source code) but also all structural information such as parent and children elements, attributes, types, etc.

xml2wiki.xsl stylesheet available in the source code repository of golfml allows for generation of Google Code Wiki Style documentation from this XML documentation format.

The xml2wiki.xsl stylesheet is the same style sheet as the one provided in xframe (called xml2html.xsl) but has been modified to generate wiki-style text rather than HTML.
