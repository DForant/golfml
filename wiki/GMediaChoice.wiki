			A media is either embedded in the golfml document or a URI (link) to it.
			We currently removed the ability to store media inside a golfml document for performance purposes
			and to limit the size of golfml document.
			Embedded storage of media in golfml document should be limited to small size items such as vector logo
			and small images.
