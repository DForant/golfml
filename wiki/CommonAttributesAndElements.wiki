The following attributes are used in several elements. They always refer to their parent element.

== Dates ==

 # DateFrom - Date of first use of the golf holes as described in the element.
 # DateTo - Date of last use of the golf holes as described in the element.

== Unique Identifiers ==

The attribute `id` is used to identify an element in the GolfML document.
