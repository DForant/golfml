= Description =

Here is a suggestion for a short explanation of golfml, to be used in pop-up window or baloon help:

    GolfML is a text-based data format used to exchange golf data between applications and web sites.
    Golf course information such as scorecard and yardage books, or golf round scores
    and statistics are the most common information carried by golfml.
