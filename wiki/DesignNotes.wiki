= Grouping of elements =

Since XML Schema leaves us with `choice`, `all` and `sequence` to compose elements, we sometimes added an intermediate element to better control cardinality and still offer full flexibily for order of appearance of elements.

For example, instead of
{{{
<hole>
 ...
  <stroke (detail) />
  <stroke (detail) />
  <stroke (detail) />
 ...
</hole>
}}}
we added a container element such as:
{{{
<hole>
 ...
  <stroke-detail>
    <stroke (detail) />
    <stroke (detail) />
    <stroke (detail) />
  </stroke-detail>
 ...
</hole>
}}}

The stroke-detail element is not required in GolfML but its added construnct allows for better cardinality control of the parent element (a `all` construct).
