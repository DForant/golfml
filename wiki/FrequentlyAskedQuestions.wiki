I have a distribution system. I don't want ot change my code. Others should adapt their code to mine.

I have the best application. Others will comply to mine.

I don't want others to steal my data.
Do you really "own" your data?

GolfML is verbose. My code is more compact. I don't need the extra stuff.

GolfML is too complicated.

GolfML does not suit my needs.

Why can't I dump everything in the <application> element? It would make a valid golfml document.
