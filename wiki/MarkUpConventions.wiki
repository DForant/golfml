#summary Conventions Used in Mark-Up Definitions.

= Introduction =

A few notes on conventions used.

= Element and Attribute Names =

We use dash-separated-lower-case-names rather than firstLetterCapitalizedNames. Just a choice.

Attribute ID can be capitalized to stand out.

= Elements or Attributes =

This is an eternal debate. We will find a consistant approach to this, but there is no rule to impose the use of one over the other.

= Notes on ID and IDREF =

Golf Markup Language makes extensive use of ID and IDREF to maintain cross references of data.

== ID ==

The ID of an element of type _x_ should be prefixed by the object _type_, like this `<x ID="`*`x-`*`1234ab" />`.

== IDREF Elements and Attributes ==

When an element or an attribute refers to a object of type _x_, its name should be _xref_:
{{{
<x ID="x-123abc" />
...
<y xref="x-123abc" />
}}}
or
{{{
<xref>x-123abc</xref>
}}}
