#summary Case Study 1: Design of a yardage book with Google Earth

= Introduction =

The purpose of this project is to design a professional looking yardage book and scorecard for a golf course.

= Procedure =

== Collect Information ==

The first step is to collect information about the golf course: Name, address, and contact information such as telephone number.

== Design in Google Earth ==

Spot the golf course in Google Earth. Start drawing polygons around elements of the golf course.

The secret of easy yardage book design resides in conventions used to speed up and automate conversions between data format. We recommend using the following folder structure for Google Earth:

{{{
  |
  +- Country Club Name
      |
      +- Golf Course Name
            |
            +- Hole 1
                  |
                  +O Green
                  +O Tee Black
                  +O Fairway
                  +O Green-side bunker
                  +O Tree
                     ...
            +- Hole 2
                  |
                  +- (...) Placemarks and polygons for second hole
                     ...
      +- Golf Course No 2 Name
            |
            +- Hole 1
               ...
  |
  +- Another Country Club Name
      |
      ...
}}}

This design accomodates for several country clubs, hosting one or more golf courses.

The name of polygons and placement is also important. To be automagically recognized, the polygon or placemark name should contain the following string:

|| *Name contains* || *Recognized as *||
|| tee || tee ||
|| fairway || fairway ||
|| green || green ||
|| fringe || fringe ||
|| tree || tree ||
|| trees || trees ||
|| bush || bush ||
|| semi || semi-rough ||
|| rough || rough ||
|| heavy || heavy-rough ||
|| trap || trap ||
|| bunker || trap ||
|| greenside || greenside-trap ||
|| fairway-trap || fairway-trap ||
|| front || front-water ||
|| water || water ||
|| lateral || lateral-water ||
|| path || path ||
|| building || building ||
|| construction || building ||
|| obstruction || obstruction ||
|| out-of-bound || out-of-bound ||
|| oob || out-of-bound ||
|| contour || hole-contour ||
