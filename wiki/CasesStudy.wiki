= Introduction =

Please visit the source code repository for golfml document instances.
 
The primary goal of golfml is to provide a XML based data format. This data format is formalized in an XML Schema.

To illustrate the usefulness and the purpose of the golfml data format, we also provide a few sample stylesheets to transform golfml documentS to other useful data format.


== GolfML To HTML ==

Several stylesheets convert simple GolfML documents into various HTML files.

 * `custom-scorecard.xsl` - Prints a standard scorecard for a golf course, with or without score information for up to four players.
 * `custom-scorecard.xsl` - Prints a standard scorecard for a golf course, with or without score information for up to four players.
 * `score.xsl` - Prints a scorecard for a round of golf for up to four players.
 * `simple-score.xsl` - Prints a simpler scorecard for each golfer for a round of golf.
 * `static-course.xsl` - Prints a standard scorecard for a golf course.


== GolfML To SVG ([http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics Scalable Vector Graphics]) ==

This prototype stylesheet format the geographic information of a single hole to a SVG drawing.

Geographic information was collected by drawing polygons in Google Earth. The KML file generated by Google Earth was incorporated in golfml.
