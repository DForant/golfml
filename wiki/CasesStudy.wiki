The primary goal of golfml is to provide a XML based data format. This data format is formalized in an XML Schema.

To illustrate the usefulness and the purpose of the golfml data format, we also provide a few sample stylesheets to transform golfml documentS to other useful data format.


== golfml2html ==

Prints a standard scorecard for a golf course, with or without score information for up to four players.


== golfml2svg ==

This prototype stylesheet format the geographic information of a single hole to a SVG drawing.

Geographic information was collected by drawing polygons in Google Earth. The KML file generated by Google Earth was incorporated in golfml.
