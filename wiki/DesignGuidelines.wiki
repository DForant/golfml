= Introduction =

This section introduce conventions use in the Golf Markup Language and its definition.

= GolfML Document =

Elements and attributes are named used English language common terms and vocabulary.
In general, use elements for data that will be produced or consumed by an application and attributes for metadata.   
A good rule of thumb is to use elements for nouns and attributes for adjectives.


== Naming Conventions ==

=== Elements and Types ===
Elements and XML schema types should be defined using dash ('-') separated words.
Element and type names can be any length. They should be meaningful.
Example:

 * golf-courses
 * tee-time


=== Attributes ===

Attributes should be defined using dash ('-') separated words.
Example:

 * length-units
 * media-type


=== Plurals ===

Collections of elements of the same type can be organized into a parent element. The name of the parent element should be a plural form of the children elements.

= GolfML Schema =

Types are `CamelCase `.

Enumeration and list types ends with Enum.

Relational keys are prefixed with PK_ and FK_, identifier are prefixed with ID_
