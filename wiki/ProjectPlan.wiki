= Project Plan =

== Phase 1: Scorecards ==

  * Project documentation and planning
  * Definitions, vocabulary and markup conventions
  * Golf course descrition.
  * Rounds of golf description.

Most basic scorecard programs should be able to exchange data for round recording.

== Phase 2: (Single) Player Statistics and Strokes Details ==

We have plans to further enhance and generalize the recording of golf-related data:

  * Rounds and strokes details.
  * Analytic data and statistics.

The focus of phase 1 and 2 is to provide a framework to record rounds of golf details and store denormalized statistics.
The public of these first two phases are individual golfers who want to store information about their game.

== Phase 3: Globalization of Rounds and Notion of Tournament(s) ==

  * Ability to record and report scores for a large population of players and record tournament details.
