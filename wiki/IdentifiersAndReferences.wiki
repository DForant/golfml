#summary GolfML Identifier and References
#sidebar TableOfContents

The ultimate goal of GolfML is to store golf course descriptions and player scorecards in GolfML formatted documents that are spread all over the world.

We provide a way to uniquely identify a golf course, or a player, or other object of interest for the game of golf and always refer to it using the same information.

== Identifiers ==

GolfML needs to uniquely identify the following entities:

 # Countries
 # Municipalities
 # Country Clubs
 # Golf courses
 # Sets of tees
 # Players

Other applications may require identifications of other entities.

A golf course should be defined once and for all other GolfML document instances.

=== Golf Courses ===

To insure uniqueness of golf courses, we build a identifier on the following unambiguous attributes:

 # Country: We use the *ISO 3166 2 letter code* to uniquely identify the *country* where the golf course is located.
 # Municipality: We use either the *postal code* (which should be unique in a given country) to uniquely identify a place in a country. If the country does not use postal code, the name of the municipality should be used instead.
 # Country-club name: The name of the country club, park, facility... where the golf course is located.
 # Golf course name: The name of the golf course at the above location. Some locations offer more than one golf course.

To identify a precise set of tees for a round of golf, the following identifier is added:

 # Tee set name: The name of the set of tees used to play the round from. If sets of tees have no names, colours should be used instead.

=== Players ===

Golfers are uniquely identified by the following combination:

 # Name: The full name of the golfer
 # Date of birth: Date of birth of the golfer.

=== Other Elements ===

Inside a GolfML document, we use the following identifiers:

 # Golf clubs: A golf club is a complex description of a club to play golf with all its technical and commercial information.
 # Golf bag: A golf bag is a collection of golfing equipment that includes not only golf clubs but also balls, apparel, etc.

= Naming Convention =

For a given entity, we defined a Identifier Group of Elements.

For example, to uniquely identify a player in GolfML, we use the following elements:
{{{
<player>
  <name>Tiger Woods</name>
  <date-of-birth>1975-12-30</date-of-birth>
</player>
}}}

We create a group named *`ID_Player`* which contains the following elements:
{{{
<xs:sequence>
  <xs:element name="player.name" type="xs:string"/>
  <xs:element name="player.date-of-birth" type="xs:date"/>
</xs:sequence>
}}}
Elements in the group are named after the GolfML hierarchy of elements used in the key. Name-forming element names are separated by period.
{{{
<player>
  <name>
  <date-of-birth>
}}}
becomes:
{{{
<player-ref [remote-golfml-url="http://tigerwoods.com/profile.xml"]>
  <player.name>Tiger Woods</player.name>
  <player.date-of-birth>1975-12-30</player.date-of-birth>
</player-ref>
}}}

= Surrogate Keys =

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key Surrogate keys] are often used by applications and always difficult to serialize. GolfML conveniently offer a complex type [CUID UID] to serialize such surrogate keys and store them inside a GolfML document.

Example:
{{{
<player>
  <uid>2593-3953-3919-9386</uid>
  <name>Tiger Woods</name>
  <date-of-birth>1975-12-30</date-of-birth>
</player>
}}}
