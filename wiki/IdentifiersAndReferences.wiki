#summary GolfML Identifier and References

= Introduction =

The ultimate goal of GolfML is to store golf course descriptions and player scorecards in GolfML formatted documents.
GolfML documents are spread all over the world.


== Identifiers ==

GolfML needs to uniquely identify the following entities:

 # Golf courses
 # Players

A golf course should be defined once and for all other GolfML document instances.

=== Golf Courses ===

To insure uniqueness of golf courses, we build a identifier on the following unambiguous attributes:

 # Country: We use the ISO 3166 2 letter code to uniquely identify the country where the golf course is located.
 # Municipality: We use either the postal code (which should be unique in a given country) to uniquely identify a place in a country. If the country does not use postal code, the name of the municipality should be used instead.
 # Country-club name: The name of the country club, park, facility... where the golf course is located.
 # Golf course name: The name of the golf course at the above location. Some locations offer more than one golf course.

To identify a precise set of tees for a round of golf, the following identifier must be added:

 # Tee set name: The name of the set of tees used to play the round from. If sets of tees have no names, colours shuold be used instead.

=== Players ===
